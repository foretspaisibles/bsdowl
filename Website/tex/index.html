<p id="INTRODUCTION">The BSD Make Pall&agrave;s Scripts may be used
to ease the production of TeX and LaTeX documents. As the TeX
toolchain functions mostly like a compiler toolchain, TeX document
production falls in the predilection domain of Make.</p>

<h1>Foreword: working with TeX or LaTeX</h1>

<p>There is multiple TeX formats in use, plain TeX and LaTeX are
example of such formats. The LaTeX format enjoys a wide community
of users, so the module latex.doc.mk is used in examples. However
most of the following applies to the generic tex.doc.mk as well.
Some paragraphs in the sequel documents mechanisms specific to
latex.doc.mk, they are explicitly identified as such.</p>

<h1>Simple documents</h1>

<p>The preparation of a simple document with LaTeX itself is very
easy, thus the use of BPS may at a first glance look like a useless
complication instead of a simplification. It provides already some
help, however.</p>

<h2>The first time</h2>

<p>Suppose the file script.tex holds your manuscript, put it in a
directory dedicated to your document, and create a file Makefile
(note the leading capital) with the following content:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = script.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>Your document's directory contains now the paper.tex file and
the Makefile above. Point your shell's working directory to this
one, and issue the <em>make</em> command:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ make
make build
===&gt; Multipass job for script.dvi (aux)
latex script.tex
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)
entering extended mode
(./script.tex
LaTeX2e &lt;2003/12/01&gt;
...
</pre>

<p>If your manuscript has no error, you end up with the following
object files in your working directory:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ ls
Makefile    script.log
script.aux  script.tex
script.dvi  script.toc
</pre>

<p>Once you are done with the objects, you can clean the directory
with the <em>make clean</em> mantra:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ make clean
rm -f  script.dvi script.log script.aux script.toc
</pre>

<p>Cleaning the directory is an optional step, but prevents your
storage and your archive media to end up filled with unused data,
that can be quickly recreated on demand. While DVI files are
usually very small, a few hundred kilobytes, the PS or PDF objects
are often much larger.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Before you clean up your working directory with the <em>make
clean</em> mantra, you you may wish to store the objects you
created in some adequate place of the local filesystem. This step
is called <em>installation</em> of your document, because it is
analogous to the installation of a program you freshly compiled.
You require the installation of your document with the <em>make
install</em> command, but you must first tell make which place is
actually adequate. This is done by assigning the DOCUMENTDIR
variable with the path to the directory you want your files copied
to, as displayed by the following Makefile:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOCUMENTDIR = ${HOME}/doc
DOC = script.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>You can then proceed with the <em>make install</em> command:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ make install
install -d /home/michi/doc
install -o michi -g michi -m 440 script.dvi /home/michi/doc
</pre>

<p>In comparison with the manual approach for storing the object in
a safe place with the <em>cp</em> command, you save retyping the
target directory name the next time you update your document. Plus,
it eases the organization of your document sources library and
scales to a large number of documents, see <em>Working with a large
number of documents</em> below. It is therefore very useful when
you prepare a local copy of your web page, where you distribute
papers you wrote, before you upload it on the web serser.</p>

<h2>Selecting an output format</h2>

<p>The TeX toolchain is capable of producing electronic documents
in several formats. Commonly used formats are DVI, PostScript (PS)
and PDF. The TEXDEVICE variable governs the format of documents
produced with the help of latex.doc.mk. Its value is usually
<i>dvi</i>, so that latex.doc.mk will produce a DVI file from your
source.</p>

<h2>Drafts and multipass jobs</h2>

<p><em>This section is mostly specific to the latex.doc.mk script,
the generic tex.doc.mk does not take special care for multipass
jobs.</em></p>

<p>The latex.tex.mk enforces multipass treatment of your
manuscript, because LaTeX needs this to produce correct cross
references created with <em>label</em> and <em>ref</em> commands
within your document. In the early existence of a document, updates
are likely to be frequent and it is thus desirable to avoid the
lenghty multiple passes processing. The module latex.tex.mk has a
draft mode for this. To enable the draft mode, set make's variable
DRAFT to yes, this is done by adding an appropriate statement in
the Makefile, as shown by the following example:</p>

<pre class="file">
DRAFT?= yes
DOC = script.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>The statement <em>DRAFT?=</em> is a special form of an
assignement statement, that allows you to type <em>make
DRAFT=no</em> at the shell prompt if you want to re-enable
multipass processing of your jobs for one time. When you have
finished polishing your manuscript, you can remove the DRAFT
assignement, your paper is then ready for a last <em>make</em> run
producing the final version of your document. If you are satisfied
with it, you can <em>install</em> it</p>

<p>When working on a document, it might be useful to keep copies of
the objects you produced at some point of your work. For instance,
pciture yourself sending a copy of your work to a friend. Your
friend will read your paper with attention and send you back his
comments, but in meanwhile, you kept on improving your document.
When you receive the comments of your friend, you will compare them
to the document you sent him. It is therefore useful to keep a copy
of it. The best way to do this is probably to use a RCS, a software
system managing history of files. If you do not use such a system,
you will be happy to learn that tex.doc.mk defines a variable
DRAFTTIMESTAMP, that expands to a time stamp.</p>

<h2>A split document</h2>

<p>If you are working on a complex document, you certainly have
split your sources into several files. Usually one file per
chapter, or per section, plus a main file containing the preamble
and many <em>input</em> statements to instruct LaTeX to read all of
the files actually containing the document.</p>

<p>Assume that your document is split into a main file galley.tex
and two other files part1.tex and part2.tex. Your galley.tex
certainly looks like this:</p>

<pre class="file">
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\input{part1}
\input{part2}
\end{document}
</pre>

<p>A suitable Makefile is then:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = galley.tex
SRCS = part1.tex
SRCS+= part2.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<h1>Figures with METAPOST</h1>

<p>Modules latex.doc.mk and tex.doc.mk comes with a nice support
for <a href=
"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html">METAPOST</a>
generated pictures, provided you have <a href=
"http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a> and a working
TeX installation. This is something worth noting, since METAPOST is
often the right tool to be used for drawing figures appearing in
TeX documents, but support for it is missing in many GUI editors
for LaTeX.</p>

<p>Assume you prepared illustrations for your article with
METAPOST, and split your illustrations into two files illustr1.mp
and illustr2.mp. To let latex.doc.mk handle the production of your
figures, add FIGS statements to your Makefile:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = galley.tex
SRCS = part1.tex
SRCS+= part2.tex
FIGS = illustr1.mp
FIGS+= illustr2.mp
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>Then type in <i>make</i> at the shell prompt. The latex.doc.mk
will then figure out how many illustrations are present in each
file, and produce the image files required by your TEXDEVICE.</p>

<p><i>Discovering METAPOST.</i> If you do not know about METAPOST
but are interested by it, the first good news is that this program
is included by many (if not all) TeX distributions. The second good
news is that you can easily find plenty of information and examples
of its use on the WWW. For instance the <a href=
"http://www.tug.org/metapost.html">TeX users group</a> has a page
on its website devoted to this tool. The list you will find there
is pretty long, so let me add that I especially like the
introduction written by <a href=
"http://remote.science.uva.nl/~heck/Courses/mptut.pdf">Andr&eacute;
Heck</a>, it might be a good starting point for you.</p>

<h1>A complex document</h1>

<p>We illustrate the use of BPS in the production of more complex
documents. We assume that you have two documents whose sources are
living in the same file, let's say an article and an abridged
version of this article. These files share a macro file macro.tex,
but are otherwise rather independent. The article features a table
that is generated by a small program <em>gentable</em> sitting in
the document's directory. The rest of the text is split across
section1.tex and section2.tex. The summary has just one text file
summary.tex. The Makefile used looks like this:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = article.tex
DOC+= summary.tex

SRCS = macros.tex
SRCS.article.tex = section1.tex
SRCS.article.tex+= section2.tex
SRCS.article.tex+= table.tex

table.tex: gentable
    ./gentable &gt; ${.TARGET}

.include "latex.doc.mk"

CLEANFILES+= table.tex
</pre>

<h1>Bibliography</h1>

<p>BPS supports the preparation if bibliographies with BibTeX.
First, you must be sure that the program TeX will find the
bibliographic databases you enumerated in your document with
<em>bibliography</em> statements.</p>

<h1>Index</h1>

<p>At the time of writing, there is no specific provision in BPS to
help the preparation of LaTeX documents with an index.</p>
