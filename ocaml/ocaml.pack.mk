### SYNOPSIS

# PACK=		minibasic
# SRCS=		main.ml
# SRCS+=	basic_types.ml
# SRCS+=	basic_parser.mly
# SRCS+=	basic_lexer.mll
#
# .include "ocaml.pack.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# Build an OCaml packed module as with the `-pack` options of the
# compiler.
#
# It supports building bytecode and native libraries, ocamlfind,
# lexers and parsers generated by ocamllex and ocamlyacc and
# debugging, profiling as well.

#  PACK
#   Name of the packed module
#
#   This can actually be a list of packed modules.  In this case for
#   each `module` a variable `SRCS.module` should specify files that
#   will be part of the packed `module`.
#
#
#  SRCS
#   Files that must be compiled
#
#   It can list implementation files, interface files, lexer and
#   parser definitions. It is not necessary to specify interface file
#   if an implementation is present.
#
#   For each packed `module`, if there is an interface file
#   `${module}.mli`, it is compiled and used.
#
#
#  DIRS
#   Directories that are searched for libraries or compiled modules
#
#
#  PKGS
#   OCamlfind packages that are used
#
#
#  LIBOWN, LIBGRP, LIBMODE, LIBDIR, LIBNAME
#   Parameters of the module installation
#
#   See `bps.own.mk` for a closer description of these variables.
