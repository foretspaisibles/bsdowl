### SYNOPSIS

# LIBRARY=	newton
# SRCS+=	newton.ml
#
# .include "ocaml.lib.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# Build an ocaml library, compiling each of the module listed in SRCS
# and creating a library named as LIBRARY.
#
# It supports building bytecode and native libraries, ocamlfind,
# lexers and parsers generated by ocamllex and ocamlyacc and
# debugging, profiling as well.

# Variables:
#
#
#  LIBRARY
#   The name of the library
#
#
#  SRCS
#   Files to put in the library
#
#   It can list implementation files, lexer and parser definitions.
#
#
#  LIBOWN, LIBGRP, LIBMODE, LIBNAME
#   Paramters of the library installation
#
#   See `bps.own.mk` for a closer description of these variables.
#
#
#  LIBDIR [${ocamllibdir}${PACKAGEDIR}]
#   The installation target for libraries
#
#   The value defined in `bps.own.mk` is suited for C libraries but not
#   for OCaml objects that are rather installed in the same location as
#   the standard library.
#
#
#  ocamllibdir [${libdir}]
#   Directory for ocaml libraries
#
#   See "USES+=site-lib" below.
#
#
# Uses:
#
#  site-lib: No argument allowed
#   Use ${libdir}/ocaml/site-lib as default value for ocamllibdir
